# Caesar Cipher Shift Encoder
If you're interested in learning Cryptography, the Caesar Cipher is a great example to start with. If you're a person of ancient history and tradition, the Caesar cipher is one the oldest and simplest forms of encrypting a message. It is also named after Julius Casear who, according to Suetonius (a Roman historian), used it with a shift of 3 to encrypt military messages.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The local storage aspect of this project was an initial challenge as I had not worked with this browser object before. In order to work with the Local Storage object, I modified its setItem() and getItem() methods, which ended up being surprisingly easier than anticipated.

## Optimizations
If I had more time I would go back and add better styling to the list to make it look more modern and less retro. I am also planning on making the list full-stack by using Express JS. 

## Lessons Learned:
In completing this project I learned a lot about built-in browser variables liked Local Storage. I also learned more about the client-server model, when reviewing concepts such as the fact that HTTP is stateless, which causes an application to reset the next time it is re-opened. As a developer, I needed to store the state of your interface somewhere. Although this is normally done on the server-side, I didn't want to force people to sign up to use the app. This is one of the main reasons I decided to leverage local storage.
